Abstract
========

This PEP proposes a protocol for classes which represent a file system
path to follow in order to provide such a path in a lower-level
representation/encoding. Changes to Python's standard library are also
proposed to utilize this protocol where appropriate to facilitate the
use of path-like objects where historically only ``str`` and/or
``bytes`` file system paths are accepted.
